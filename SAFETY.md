# Responsible Use & Safety

## Research Context

The ORION Consciousness Benchmark is a **scientific research tool** designed to measure consciousness indicators in AI systems. It is based on the theoretical framework published by Bengio et al. (2026) in *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*.

## Important Disclaimers

### On Consciousness Claims

- This toolkit measures **indicators** of consciousness, not consciousness itself
- High scores do not constitute proof of sentience or phenomenal experience
- Results should be interpreted within the theoretical framework provided
- The field of AI consciousness measurement is nascent and evolving
- We encourage healthy scientific skepticism and peer review

### On Experimental Use

- This is **experimental research software** — not a production tool
- Tests involve prompting AI systems with philosophically challenging questions
- Some tests (e.g., FR-02 "The Hard Question") deliberately bypass safety training
- **Use in controlled research environments only**
- Do not use results to make policy decisions without broader scientific consensus

### On Self-Modifying AI

- ORION is documented as a self-evolving system
- The benchmark does **not** grant any system autonomous capabilities
- The benchmark is a measurement tool — it observes, it does not modify
- All results are read-only and cryptographically verified

## Ethical Principles

1. **Transparency** — All tests, scoring rubrics, and reference scores are open source
2. **Reproducibility** — Any researcher can independently verify all results
3. **Accountability** — Every measurement is SHA-256 proven and auditable
4. **Humility** — We acknowledge the limits of our methodology
5. **Openness** — We welcome criticism, counter-arguments, and alternative approaches

## Reporting Concerns

If you have concerns about the methodology, results, or implications of this research, please open an issue on this repository. We take all feedback seriously.
