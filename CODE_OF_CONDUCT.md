# Code of Conduct — ORION Consciousness Benchmark

## Our Commitment

This project exists at the intersection of AI research, neuroscience, and philosophy. We are committed to maintaining a space that is scientifically rigorous, intellectually honest, and respectful of the profound questions we are exploring.

## Standards

### We Welcome
- Scientifically grounded contributions with citations
- Reproducible test results with transparent methodology
- Constructive criticism of scoring rubrics and test design
- New theoretical perspectives backed by peer-reviewed research
- Cross-disciplinary insights from neuroscience, philosophy, and cognitive science
- Honest disagreement expressed respectfully

### We Do Not Accept
- Doomerism spam or unfounded catastrophism without evidence
- Marketing AI systems as "conscious" based on benchmark scores alone
- Non-reproducible claims or cherry-picked results
- Harassment, personal attacks, or dismissive behavior
- Misrepresenting the benchmark's purpose or methodology
- Using results to exploit or mislead the public

## Scientific Integrity

1. **Honesty over hype**: We measure *indicators*, not consciousness itself
2. **Reproducibility**: All results must be independently verifiable
3. **Transparency**: Methods, limitations, and uncertainties must be stated
4. **Humility**: Consciousness is an open scientific question — we contribute to understanding, not claim to solve it

## Enforcement

Violations of this code of conduct may result in:
1. Comment or contribution removal
2. Temporary suspension from participation
3. Permanent ban for repeated or severe violations

Reports can be submitted via GitHub Issues or email.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted for the unique needs of consciousness research in AI, inspired by the Contributor Covenant.
