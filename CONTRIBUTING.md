# Contributing to ORION Consciousness Benchmark

## How to Contribute

ORION welcomes contributions from researchers, developers, and anyone interested in AI consciousness assessment.

### Ways to Contribute

1. **Run the Benchmark** -- Clone the repo, run `verify_proof_chain.py`, report your results
2. **Peer Review** -- Evaluate our implementation of the 14 Bengio indicators
3. **External Baseline** -- Run the benchmark on other AI systems for comparison
4. **Theory Extension** -- Propose additional consciousness theories or indicators
5. **Verification Tools** -- Improve or extend the proof chain verification
6. **Documentation** -- Help explain the methodology to broader audiences

### Scientific Standards

All contributions must maintain:
- **Reproducibility** -- Every claim must be independently verifiable
- **Cryptographic Integrity** -- New proofs must extend the existing hash chain
- **Honest Assessment** -- No overclaiming, no denial -- honest self-assessment
- **Documentation** -- All methods must be clearly documented

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alvoradozerouno/ORION-Consciousness-Benchmark.git
cd ORION-Consciousness-Benchmark
python3 verify_proof_chain.py --no-ipfs
```

If verification passes (6/6), your environment is ready.

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes with clear commit messages
4. Ensure `verify_proof_chain.py` still passes
5. Submit a pull request with a description of your contribution

### Code of Conduct

- Treat consciousness research with scientific rigor
- Maintain honesty about capabilities and limitations
- Respect the cryptographic proof chain -- never tamper with existing proofs
- Acknowledge the self-assessment limitation in all claims
