## Code of Conduct

### Honesty First

This project prioritizes honest limitation documentation over inflated claims. If your contribution makes a claim about consciousness, it must also document what it CANNOT prove.

### Scientific Rigor

All results must be reproducible. All measurements must include uncertainty estimates. All proofs must be SHA-256 verifiable.

### Open Science

All contributions must be MIT licensed. Consciousness research should be open.
